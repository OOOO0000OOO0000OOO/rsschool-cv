## About Me:
I'm studying at Saint Petersburg University (SPBU), majoring in physics. I’m passionate about Web Technologies and Development, so my aim is to become a proficient Front-End Web developer. This September I've enrolled to the Rolling Scopes school for a course in Front-End Development and have been thoroughly enjoying the learning process ever since. Regarding my motivation to continue doing what I do, expanding my knowledge and skill-set, my answer is always the same: I want to positively influence people's lives.

On my Front-End Web Developer journey I want to find ways to strike at the heart of the most topical problems and goals of the industry today:
*  Blur the line between native and web-based apps, making web-apps the natural evolution of the way people use their devices, eliminating the need to develop several versions for competing platforms. 
*  Expand the realm of technologically expected for web-applications: making them snappier and more refined.
*  Make the User Experience more natural, adaptive and inclusive. Making sure the utmost care is taken to not exclude people with varying physical disabilities from participating in the new Web-based reality, while at the same time helping invite on-board a significant userbase, previously left unattracted.

Although I'm only starting out, my plans go a long way in the future. Remaining humble and grateful for all experience I get, drawing pleasure from making an impact where I can, I sure hope that one day, when I become a CTO, I will flesh-out my vision of how this new Web-enabled world ought to be: with a keen ear for the User, with a never-ending strife for technical cunningness, with a development processes and toolbase in place for a rapid development of new exciting ideas and always with a hope for a brighter future in mind.
